    <p>Drones are becoming a popular way to film sporting events.

They offer a unique perspective that can help athletes improve their performance.

Many sports leagues have started using drones to film games and practices.

The footage can be used to analyze an athlete's technique and make adjustments.

Drones are also being used to capture exciting moments during live events.

Some athletes are even using drones to train.

By watching footage of themselves from a drone's perspective, they can get a better idea of their form and make necessary improvements.
</p>
As drone technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative uses for them in the world of sports.

<p>The Snickometer is a device that measures the amount of time it takes for a cricket ball to make a noise when it hits the bat.</p>
<p>
Batmen use the Snickometer to help them time their shots.
</p>
<p>
The device is placed at the back of the bat, and when the ball hits the bat, the Snickometer measures the time it takes for the sound to travel from the bat to the device.
</p>
The Snickometer is a valuable tool for batmen, as it can help them to improve their timing and technique.
<p>
It is also useful for umpires, as it can help them to make more accurate decisions about whether a batsman has played a shot too early or too late.

      <h1>Video Assistant Referee (VAR)</h1>

    </header>
<p>In 2018, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) approved the use of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in professional football matches.</p>
<p>
VAR is a system that uses video and audio technology to help referees make decisions on the field of play.
</p>
<p>
VAR can be used to review four types of decisions: goals, penalty kicks, straight red cards, and mistaken identity. 
</p>
VAR was first used during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and it was generally well-received by fans and players alike.
<p>
VAR has since been implemented in a number of professional leagues around the world, including Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States. 
</p>
<p>
There have been some criticisms of VAR, mostly centered around the fact that the system can slow down the flow of the game.
</p>
<p>
However, many believe that the benefits of VAR far outweigh the negatives, and that the system is here to stay.
